## StrikeLeaderboards
#### Spigot plugin addon for StrikePractice. Simple GUI with top statistics including elos and other statistics (e.g. kills, deaths, event wins)

Currently [StrikePracticeAPI](https://github.com/toppev/StrikePracticeAPI/ "StrikePracticeAPI repository") doesn't have all methods needed so the [pom.xml](https://github.com/toppev/StrikeLeaderboards/blob/213cfee1a9790bad68a2661f2da2edd40a8483ae/pom.xml#L53) has StrikePractice.jar system file dependency, meaning you must have StrikePractice.jar (the plugin itself).
This will hopefully change in the near future (and migrate to jitpack.io or host a maven repository)
